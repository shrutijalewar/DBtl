### About

This a good-looking web crawler application that will crawl a website for you and return with the images found on the webpage. It will then show you the found images in a snazzy slideshow. It is built with Angular.js and Foundations 5 on the front-end and Hapi.js, Node.js, and Mongoose.js on the back-end.
